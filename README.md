# Thanos in React

The goal of this project is nothing more than to provide a demonstration in React of how to do contract-style testing but without going full on into a tool like Pact.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but then heavily modified from that default.

To start the application, from the project directory run the following:

### `npm start`

This will run the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000/thanos](http://localhost:3000/thanos) to view it in the browser.

The whole point of this is to be able to run tests, which you can do as follows:

### `npm test`

This launches the test runner.

Note, however, that the tests are going to be added as part of a blog article on this topic. So the repo itself contains no tests.
